# cc-default-ml
This project contains multiple models that will be used to accurately identify if a credit card customer will default based on several features. Each model will be evaluated on multiple metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, and (maybe) Area Under Precision Recalll Curve. The models will then be compared with each other to see which model is most suitable for the classification task.
